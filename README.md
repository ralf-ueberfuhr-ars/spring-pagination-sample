# Spring Pagination Samples

Just start as any other Spring Boot app and open `http://localhost:8080`.
This will open a swagger UI with a list resource that can be read out using
 - Page-based pagination or
 - Cursor-based pagination.

You can find [request samples](http-requests) in this project too.
